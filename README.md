Python Memcached2
=================

A new 100% Python memcache client library.  This is targeted at Python 3,
but I anticipate using 3to2 to convert it to Python 2 and work there.

2013-04-01: I've just started working on this, and it's a side project for a
side project, so I have no timeline.  Use the regular python-memcached.
I assure you it's not an April fools joke though.
