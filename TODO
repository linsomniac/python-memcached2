Post socket server for unit test to let others know about it.
Better name for ValueMemcache?
Should a ValueMemcache CAS update cause a refresh of the CAS value?
      Do we return the CAS value from the set() operation?

Decide on what to do about automatic pickling.
Convert test_serverconnection.py from class FakeMemcacheServer
      to CommandServer where appropriate.
Do we want to use flags for pickling/compression indication, or allow
      users to use it?  Or have a slightly higher level sits on top of
      Memcache() and can do pickling and compression?
Make "get" accept multiple keys (see "get <key>*" in protocol docs).
      How will that work, considering they could hash to multiple servers?
      Collect the ones that go to the same server and send them as groups?
Make it so that Value wrapper can merge get_multi results?
Make a old memcache compatible interface (to the extent possible)?
