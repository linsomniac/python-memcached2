Consistent hashing when servers are down.
Server connection pooling.
Modify the _send_command code so that the server can be queried independently.
Modify the _send_command so the server can be specified instead of key.
Modify get_multi to use the above.
Is there a "gets <key>*"?
Modify the Mapper class so you can pre-grab values via multi?
set_multi?  If so, it needs to have a select loop for sending and
      receiving so that there is no potential deadlocks or blocking.
Key checking code?
Decide on what to do about automatic pickling.
   Do we want to use flags for pickling/compression indication, or allow
   users to use it?  Or have a slightly higher level sits on top of
   Memcache() and can do pickling and compression?
Make it so that Value wrapper can merge get_multi results?
Make a old memcache compatible interface (to the extent possible)?
