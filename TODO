Documentation.
Make "get" accept multiple keys (see "get <key>*" in protocol docs).
      How will that work, considering they could hash to multiple servers?
      Collect the ones that go to the same server and send them as groups?
Make another wrapper class that catches exceptions.
Post socket server for unit test to let others know about it.
Decide on automatic pickling.
Do we want to use flags for pickling/compression indication, or allow
      users to use it?  Or have a slightly higher level sits on top of
      Memcache() and can do pickling and compression?
